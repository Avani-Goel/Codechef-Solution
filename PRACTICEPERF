PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.

Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for 4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 44 weeks as P_1, P_2, P_3,P_4 ,output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target.


CODE

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int count(int arr[])
{
    int count=0;
    for (int i=0; i<4; i++)
    {
        if (arr[i]>=10)
        count ++;
    }
    return count;
}
int main() 
{
    int arr[4];
    for (int i=0; i<4; i++)
    {
        cin>>arr[i];
    }
    int x=count(arr);
    cout<<x;
	return 0;
}

EXPLANATION
Input all the submissions using array. Check if each element is greater than equal to ten (if so increase count by 10). Return count.
